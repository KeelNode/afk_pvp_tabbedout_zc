## About the macro
This macro farms Zone Control game mode by capturing all 3 flags, while occasionally pressing Super to complete challenges, bounties etc.
<br> There is some setup involved so please check the "**Guide**" section below 
<br>If you are interested in learning more about how this macro works or about similar macros that work while you are tabbed out of the game join the [Discord](https://thrallway.com).

### Features:
- Captures all 3 flags in Zone Control game mode
- Increase valor points (only gain reputation if Match Score limit set to 50 or higher)
- Increase weapon level XP
- Cast Super for bounties/orbs etc.. use a Well Warlock or Bubble Titan
- Obtain event items such as Silver Leaves (during Solstice)
- Option for choosing Match Score Limit set in game (25, 50, 100)
  - 75 provides same Crucible Reputation points as 50, so I have removed that
- Option for choosing if game is on HDD or SSD to account for slow load times
### Work In Progress: 
âœ… option to swap between Score Limits of 25/50/100 - respectively prioritising and providing more rep.
<br>ðŸš§ HDD/SSD options to automagically accounting for timings, allowing fastest possible runtime of each instance.
<br>ðŸš§ Auto-setup private crucible settings for this farm.
